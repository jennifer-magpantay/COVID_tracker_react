# COVID_tracker_react
## React App to track COVID-19 spreading numbers around the globe

This app was developed following the well explained **CleverProgrammer** tutorials on [GitHub](https://github.com/CleverProgrammer) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3pIMJUZxM).

All the database information is provided by [Disease.sh - Open Disease Data](https://disease.sh/). Part of the components and styling of the app was used by importing @material-ui/core, react-chartjs-2 and leaflet maps.

Progess of the app can be checked [here](https://covid-19-tracker-16a7e.web.app/)
